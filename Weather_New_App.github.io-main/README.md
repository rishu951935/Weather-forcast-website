# 🌤️ Weather App


A **responsive Weather App** built with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**, and the **Fetch API**. This app helps you check the **current weather** of your location (with permission) or search for the weather in **any city** around the world.

## 🔍 Features


- 📍 **Current Location Weather**  
  - Automatically detects your location using the **Geolocation API** (with permission).
  - Fetches and displays weather data for your current location.

- 🔎 **City Search Functionality**  
  - Go to the **"Search Weather"** tab to find weather details of any city.
  - Just enter the city name and get real-time weather info.

- ☁️ **Weather Details Displayed**  
  - Temperature (°C)
  - Weather condition (e.g., clear, cloudy, rain)
  - Humidity, Pressure, Wind speed, and more

- 📱 **Responsive Design**  
  - Works perfectly across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.


## 🚀 How It Works

1. On load, it asks for permission to access your **device location**.
2. If granted, it fetches your **current coordinates** and uses them to retrieve weather data.
3. You can also manually **search any city** using the **search tab**.
4. Weather data is retrieved using the **OpenWeatherMap API** (or your preferred weather API).
